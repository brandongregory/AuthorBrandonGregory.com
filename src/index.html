h1: I&rsquo;m Brandon and I write things.

<p>It’s hard to remember a time I haven’t been writing. I started writing my first novel in 7th grade (it was terrible), and I’ve been writing essays and articles for one thing or another for most of my life, starting in high school. Writing is a natural expression for me, and it’s one that’s always made sense.</p>
<p>A love of writing led me to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in English at Rollins College. Over the years, I’ve written everything from technical documents to a fantasy novel to religious teaching curriculum to articles on all kinds of subjects. Writing is something I love, and I hope to keep doing it until the day I die.</p>
<p>Professionally, I’ve been building websites since 1995, and I’ve been getting paid for it since 2000. I’m currently working at Blue Rivet, a small design and development shop in the Midwest, where I serve as Lead Interactive Architect. Previously, I worked at Intouch Solutions and PlattForm (now Keypath Education).</p>
<p>My current work focuses on the intersection of the web industry and emotional intelligence, focusing on disarming tense interpersonal situations and building better and more effective relationships with the people you work with. These skills are important to anyone in the web industry, from designers and developers all the way up to managers and directors.</p>
