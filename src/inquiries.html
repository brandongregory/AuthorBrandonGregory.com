h1: Want Brandon to write for you?

<p>It should be obvious by now that I love writing. It may be the case that you need a writer. Maybe we can work something out.</p>
<h2>Article Inquiries</h2>
<p>I’m open to writing for just about any publication that would welcome my work or expertise. Just a few things to be aware of:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If there’s a woman or person of color equally qualified, ask them first.</li>
    <li>If you have no women or people of color in your list of authors, really think about getting one before approaching me. Seriously.</li>
    <li>I typically get paid for my articles. That’s not a hard rule, but it greatly increases your chances of me accepting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still interested? <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> and maybe we can work something out!</p>
<h2>Mentorship/Feedback Requests</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re just looking for someone to read over something you wrote or bounce a few ideas off of. Maybe you want to get started in writing but don’t know where to start. No problem&mdash;let’s chat. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> and let me know what you need help with.</p>
<h2>Copywriting</h2>
<p>This isn’t what I typically do, but I might make an exception for interesting projects. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> if you think your project qualifies.</p>
